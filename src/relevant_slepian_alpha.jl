 # Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 # 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 # Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 # of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            # Preamble

  # The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
# freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
# License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
# software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
# General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
# Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
# using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
# the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
# your programs, too.

  # When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
# price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
# have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
# this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
# if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
# in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  # To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
# anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
# These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
# distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

#   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
# gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
# you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
# source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
# rights.

  # We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
# (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
# distribute and/or modify the software.

  # Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
# that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
# software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
# want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
# that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
# authors' reputations.

  # Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
# patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
# program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
# program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
# patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  # The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
# modification follow.

                    # GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   # TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  # 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
# a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
# under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
# refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
# means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
# that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
# either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
# language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
# the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

# Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
# covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
# running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
# is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
# Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
# Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  # 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
# source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
# conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
# copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
# notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
# and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
# along with the Program.

# You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
# you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  # 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
# of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
# distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
# above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    # a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    # stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    # b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    # whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    # part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    # parties under the terms of this License.

    # c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    # when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    # interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    # announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    # notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    # a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    # these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    # License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    # does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    # the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

# These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
# identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
# and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
# themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
# sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
# distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
# on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
# this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
# entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

# Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
# your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
# exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
# collective works based on the Program.

# In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
# with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
# a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
# the scope of this License.

  # 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
# under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
# Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    # a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    # source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    # 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    # b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    # years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    # cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    # machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    # distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    # customarily used for software interchange; or,

    # c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    # to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    # allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    # received the program in object code or executable form with such
    # an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

# The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
# making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
# code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
# associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
# control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
# special exception, the source code distributed need not include
# anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
# form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
# operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
# itself accompanies the executable.

# If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
# access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
# access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
# distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
# compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  # 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
# except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
# otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
# void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
# However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
# this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
# parties remain in full compliance.

#   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
# signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
# distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
# prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
# modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
# Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
# all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
# the Program or works based on it.

  # 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
# Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
# original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
# these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
# restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
# You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
# this License.

  # 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
# infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
# conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
# otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
# excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
# distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
# License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
# may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
# license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
# all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
# the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
# refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

# If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
# any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
# apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
# circumstances.

# It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
# patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
# such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
# integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
# implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
# generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
# through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
# system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
# to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
# impose that choice.

# This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
# be a consequence of the rest of this License.

#   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
# certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
# original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
# may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
# those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
# countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
# the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  # 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
# of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
# be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
# address new problems or concerns.

# Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
# specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
# later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions

            # How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

#   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
# possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
# free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  # To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
# to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
# convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
# the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    # <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    # Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    # This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    # it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    # the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    # (at your option) any later version.

    # This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    # but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    # MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    # GNU General Public License for more details.

    # You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    # with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
    # 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

# Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

# If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
# when it starts in an interactive mode:

    # Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    # Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    # This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    # under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

# The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
# parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
# be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
# mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

# You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
# school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
# necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  # Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  # `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  # <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  # Ty Coon, President of Vice

# This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
# proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
# consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
# library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
# Public License instead of this License.
